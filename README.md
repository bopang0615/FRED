# FRED data pull and time series forecast

This program can help you connect with FRED database directly and query the any of series interested in with a minimal set of parameters to set. 

# Motivation
With the amount of pressure of inflation building up to our current economy, we'd love provide an easy way that helps business extract the macro economy indicator all in one place to help make better decision and/or enahnce your BI. In addition, we also add a forecast module to help predict where the curve may head to in the foreseable future.
